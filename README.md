# Build
This project uses CMake to manage build. 

To setup the build run:
```
cmake -S . -B build
```

This will setup the build source (-S) as the current directory and the build target (-B) as a folder called build.

When the build is setup the project can be built by running:
```
cmake --build build
```

And installed from the build folder by running 
```
cmake --install build
```
